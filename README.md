This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`npx create-next-app@14`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## UI Components

This project uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components which were bootstrapped with:

```bash
npx shadcn@2.3.0 init
```

The components are built on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) version 3 and offer a set of accessible, reusable, and composable UI components that can be copied and pasted into the application.

To add new components, use the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@2.3.0 add [component-name]
```
